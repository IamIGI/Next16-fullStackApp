# DEps

- React Compiler automatically optimizes your React application at build time. React is often fast enough without optimization, but sometimes you need to manually memoize components and values to keep your app responsive. This manual memoization is tedious, easy to get wrong, and adds extra code to maintain. React Compiler does this optimization automatically for you, freeing you from this mental burden so you can focus on building features.
